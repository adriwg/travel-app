Recent searches are saved to the left side panel, in clickable buttons.  User can press the button and retrieve the information about hotels again.

Single page app is responsive. On the smaller screens fewer hotels are displayed per horizontal line and recent search is moved down the page.

Two hotel cards per horizontal line are displayed on tablet screen:
